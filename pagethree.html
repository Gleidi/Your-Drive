<p>
Of course, no surprises for guessing that it's been BMWs go-to performance saloon of choice, but this version of the BMW M3 actually has turbochargers. BMW removed the high-revving, naturally aspirated V8 of the previous-generation car in favour of a twin-turbo straight-six unit to improve efficiency.
<br>
It feels more brutish and clunky when compared with the Mercedes-AMG C 63. But it’s still practical and composed with an all ground very good drive in most aspects.
Sharp steering and handling as well as good control allow you to really test it to the limit and apply force on the incredible grip levels, while the quick steering gives good and quick direction changes, too. It must be noted however that the engine can be slighty vunerable to rain compared to the AMG.
<br>
Downsizing also improves fuel economy by about 25%. In terms of key numbers, the new M3 will hit 62mph in 4.1sec (when fitted with the optional seven-speed dual-clutch gearbox) and tops out at a limited 155mph. Add on the M Driver’s pack and the limiter allows for a blistering 174mph, by far the fastest car on here.
<br>
Prices can range from £60,000-£80,000 depending on any added modifications you choose to make.

<P>The cheaper but still similar option would be the BMW E46 330(C)i ZHP. Very similar in terms of body and shape, this is the go to for someone who's pocket isn't quite as deep.
<br>An option for if the legendary M3 is out of your price range. The E46 330i ZHP will do more than just the job. 
<br>
The BMW E46 330i ZHP can be bought as an option package, which bridges the gap between this and the M3 even further. The ZHP package has almost $4000 addition in options that include styling, suspension, engine, and interior modifications. It was fitted with the M-Tech II body kit, which gave it a slightly more aggressive styling over the standard 330i. That, along with sport springs that lowered the ride height, style 135 wheels, and additional negative camber bridged the gap between it and the M3 even more.
<br>
When it comes to power, it unsurprisingly didn't get the high-revving 333 horsepower BMW S54 engine like the M3. It still came with the same M54 found in other BMW models and had any major issues cleaned up and sorted. However, it did receive a few upgrades that helped set it apart such as different camshafts and a revised ECU. This was good for 10 additional horsepower. This was coupled with a shorter final drive, dropping the 0-60 time by nearly half a second. The 0-60 time is 6 seconds and a top speed of 155mph can be achieved.
<br>
The E46 330i ZHP's following is like tradition for many fans, so prices can vary to a great degree. It's still possible to find these at a good price, and it's even possible to find ones that the owners don't realise the value of what they have. Like other collectible BMWs, certain interior and exterior color combinations can affect the sale price greatly. The best place to find good deals is Facebook Marketplace. Forums like ZHPMafia and boutique dealers such as Enthusiast Auto Group will guarantee better quality.
You can expect to splash out £15,000-£25,000 on this one if you can't get a deal on somewhere like Facebook.
