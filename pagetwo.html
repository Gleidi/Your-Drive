   To begin with arguably the biggest car brand, the German classic Mercedes Benz. As of 2020 the Mercedes AMG c43 is currently among one of the sporty favourites that Mercedes has to offer. The C43 AMG coupe is very quick off the blocks, doing the zero-to-60 mph dash in 4.5 seconds. Complementing this is a top speed of 155mph per hour.
   Digging deep into your pocket, brand new it can be expected to be around £60,000. It also has a horsepower of 384. Moreover, the slick design and shape is easy on the eye and will certainly have heads turning when you're stuck in traffic. The nine-speed automatic transmission is extremely smooth, and the all-wheel-drive system seems to add a second layer of gravity to this tremendous piece of machinery, so you'll feel very secure and strapped in when gliding at high speeds. Just watch out for those speed cameras. It's one of the only 3 door drives on this website, so it is ideal for a younger driver who can utilise the speed and good looks better than a family man, for which I would advise looking at the alternative just below. It also weighs in at slightly under two tons.

   Now onto the cheaper option. The Mercedes-Benz A-Class A180 CDI ECO SE tends to be priced around a reasonable £10,000-£14,000 and is a more family friendly option than the other car as it's larger and proposes a five door drive. This comes at the expense of a lower max speed of 118mph and a slower 0-62 dash of 11.3 seconds. In terms of looks, it still follows a very similar sleek design to the AMG, but obviously performace wise is weaker but still good.
   Powering the A180 CDI ECO is a 1.5-litre turbodiesel engine which produces 191 lb ft of torque between 1750 - 2500 rpm. It’s an advanced unit with a high pressure 1,800 bar injection system which uses magnetic valve actuation and variable turbine geometry to optimise performance and efficiency. More features include taller gearing, active aero and engine start-stop.
